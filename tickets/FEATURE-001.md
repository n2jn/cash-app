# FEATURE-001: Login Page UI Components

**Type:** Feature
**Platform:** Both
**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Created:** 2025-10-19
**Completed:** 2025-10-19
**Assignee:** ui-expert

## Description

Build the foundational UI components needed for the login page using Gluestack UI as the base. This includes form inputs, buttons, and container components that will be used by the fullstack-expert to build the login screen.

The components should leverage Gluestack UI's built-in accessibility, theming, and cross-platform support while maintaining consistency with the Gluestack UI v2.0 Design Kit in Figma.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Input component (atom) is available for email and password fields
- [x] Button component (atom) is available with primary action styling
- [x] FormField component (molecule) combines Input with label and error display
- [x] Card/Container component (molecule) is available for wrapping the login form
- [x] All components work on both React Native and web
- [x] All components support Tailwind/NativeWind styling
- [x] All components have TypeScript types
- [x] All components have Storybook stories documenting variants (51 stories total)
- [x] Components follow Gluestack UI composition patterns
- [x] Accessibility features are preserved from Gluestack UI base components

## Technical Notes

**Gluestack UI Base Components to Use:**
- Input, InputField (for text inputs)
- Button, ButtonText, ButtonSpinner (for action buttons)
- FormControl, FormControlLabel, FormControlError (for form fields)
- Box (for Card component)
- Text (for labels and errors)

**Figma Reference:**
- File Key: AVKx1rAhJojXGssnxYikYL
- Design System Root Node: 203:7391
- Components Node: 203:2

**Use Figma Tools to:**
- Get design specs for Input, Button, and Form components
- Extract exact spacing, colors, and typography
- Verify visual consistency with design system

**Component Exports:**
All components should be exported from `@cash-app/ui` for use by fullstack-expert:
```typescript
import {
  Input,
  InputField,
  Button,
  ButtonText,
  ButtonSpinner,
  FormField,
  Card
} from '@cash-app/ui'
```

**Styling Approach:**
- Use Tailwind CSS classes via NativeWind
- Extend Gluestack's default theme in gluestack-ui.config.ts
- Use design tokens from theme for colors, spacing, typography

**Accessibility:**
- Leverage Gluestack's built-in WCAG compliance
- Ensure proper label associations
- Support screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
