# Tickets

This folder contains feature tickets and tasks created by the product-manager agent.

## Ticket Format

Each ticket follows this structure:
- **ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., FEATURE-001)

- **Type**: Feature, Bug, Enhancement, Refactor
- **Platform**: Mobile, Web, Both
- **Status**: Todo, In Progress, Done

## Workflow

2. Tickets are assigned to platform-specific agents
3. Agents implement and update ticket status
4. Completed tickets are archived or marked done
